# QR.io
## A data transfer protocol using QR codes!

## What does this do?

QR.io a new way of transferring data without the need for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cables.

## Why is this needed?

QR.io relies only upon a camera and a screen, with no servers or third parties needed.
This enables file and data transfer without an internet connection and without pesky people snooping on your data!

## How do I use this?

Currently, there is only an Android app available with our technology installed.
*We'd love help porting over to other platforms, like iOS!*

## Example
### Point your device at the GIF (using the app!)
The device will vibrate when transfer is initiated and completed.

## Ideas

- [x] Turn a file into QR codes
- [x] Turn those QR codes into readable files
- [x] Create Android app to show off the technology
- [ ] Add file type compatibility (Transmit filename) 
- [ ] base64 encoded **or** ensure unicode works
- [ ] Set headers to Byte data
- [ ] Create an iOS app to show crosscompatability
- [ ] Convert the app into an API for others to use in their projects
- [ ] Enable bi-directional communication
- [ ] Speed up data transfer
  - [ ] Use bi-directional communication to discover fastest method of transfer
  - [ ] Drop frames that were successful so they are not looped again
  - [ ] Use raw pixel data for data transfer and use QR codes as an easy/fast way to talk
