# QR.io
## The new data transfer protocol using QR codes!

## What does this do?

QR.io a new way of transferring data without the need for WiFi, Bluetooth, or cables.
A camera and a screen is all you need.

## Why is this needed?

QR.io relies only upon a camera and a screen. No servers or third parties are needed.
This enables file and data transfer without an internet connection and without pesky people snooping on your data!

## How do I use this awesome idea?

As QR.io is under development, there is only an Android app (in the repo) with our technology installed.
*We'd love help porting over to other platforms, like iOS!*
