# QR.io
## The new data transfer protocol using QR codes!

## What does this do?

QR.io a new way of transferring data without the need for WiFi, Bluetooth, or cables.
A camera and a screen is all you need.

## Why is this needed?

QR.io relies only upon a camera and a screen. No servers or third parties are needed.
This enables file and data transfer without an internet connection and without pesky people snooping on your data!

## How do I use this awesome idea?

As QR.io is under development, there is only an Android app (in the repo) with our technology installed.
*We'd love help porting over to other platforms, like iOS!*

## Example
### Point your device at the GIF. (Must have the app installed!)

## Ideas - *No order*

- [x] Turn a file into QR codes
- [x] Turn those QR codes into readable files
- [x] Create Android app to show off the technology
- [ ] Create an iOS app to show crosscompatability
- [ ] Convert the app into an API for others to use in their projects
- [ ] Enable bi-directional communication
- [ ] Speed up data transfer
  - [ ] Use bi-directional communication to discover fastest method of transfer
  - [ ] Drop frames that were successful so they are not looped again
  - [ ] Use raw pixel data for data transfer and use QR codes as an easy/fast way to talk
